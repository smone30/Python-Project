# Emotion Detector from text and speech with Visualizatio

This project is a Speech and Text-based Emotion Detection system built using **Streamlit**, **Whisper (OpenAI)**, and **Machine Learning**. It supports two input types — direct text and voice — and predicts the emotion expressed using a trained model. The system also visualizes prediction confidence using `matplotlib`.

##  Features

- ✅ Emotion detection from text or transcribed voice
- ✅ Whisper model for real-time speech-to-text transcription
- ✅ Machine learning model (e.g., Logistic Regression) for emotion classification
- ✅ Confidence chart using matplotlib
- ✅ Cleaned text processing with `neattext`
